# Iris_Model
This is a Iris Classification ML Based Model
In this project, I have created API using Flask to get prediction from model.pkl 
In this project, I have used Random Forest Classifier

Step to run the model 
create a venv and install the requiremnts.txt file 
after that run the model.ipynb file and in the end you will get pickle file of ML Model.
Then, run app.py to create flask based API.
NOTE : I HAVE NOT CREATED FRONTEND OF THE FLASK MODEL. I HAVE TESTED MY MODEL'S API BY USING POSTMAN.

POSTMAN : API TESTING RESULT
